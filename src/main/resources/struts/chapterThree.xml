		This package contains the non-secure portions of the Struts 2 Portfolio.  This allows these
		public actions to share inheritance of things specialized to the non-secure portions of the application.
		
		Note, at this point, the Struts 2 Portfolio doesn't actually have any security functionality to
		check credentials or restrict access, but we have already packaged in a way that anticipates these
		needs.
